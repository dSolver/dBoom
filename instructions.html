				<h2>How To Play</h2>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Controls</h3>
				<p>If you are on a tablet, such as the Blackberry Playbook, you can tilt the screen in the direction you want your cursor to go. So for example, tilting the top of the screen down will make the cursor go up.
				</p>
				<p>The bottom right hand corner of the screen has two buttons, they have different capabilities. The first one is firing the cannon. When you tap it, the cannon will fire, and after a short delay, the explosion will take place over where the cursor was when you fired it.
				The other button is for placing a bomb. These bombs go off when a goon walks over it, causing a large explosion, killing any goon unfortunate enough to get caught in it. The two attacks have different cooltimes, the cannon's cooltime is denoted by the red circle that goes
				around the cursor, and the bomb is the smaller blue circle. There is a limited supply of bombs that increases as the round progresses if there is a factory present. Note that if the factory is destroyed, bombs will not be placeable, however any bombs on the field are still
				armed and capable.</p>
				<h3>Buildings</h3>
				<p>There are two types of buildings: The Shrine, and The Factory. For each round, there may be multiple shrines. The purpose of the game is to protect the shrines from the goons. When a goon gets close to a building, it will cause an explosion and the building will be destroyed.
				Do not let your shrine(s) get destroyed!
